  Safe Area Management
  - Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
  - Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
  - Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
  - Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.
