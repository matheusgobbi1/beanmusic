 Use functional components and hooks instead of class components
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable
- Optimize performance by minimizing useEffect and useState in render methods
- Use React.memo() for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize lists (e.g., FlatList) with props 
- Use getItemLayout for FlatList when items have consistent sizes for better performance
- Avoid anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders
